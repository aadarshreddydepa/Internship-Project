# 📄 Abstract

The Business Directory Application is a web-based platform designed to simplify the process of discovering and registering local businesses. The system enables users to search for businesses based on predefined categories and subcategories while allowing business owners to register and manage their business information efficiently.

The application focuses on delivering a seamless and intuitive user experience through structured navigation, minimal input requirements, and scalable architecture. Future enhancements such as business listings, detailed views, ratings, and user comments aim to improve user engagement and trust, making the platform a reliable solution for local business discovery.

# 📘 Introduction

In today’s digital era, finding reliable local businesses quickly and efficiently is essential for users. Traditional methods of searching for businesses often lack organization, personalization, and real-time updates.

The Business Directory Application addresses this gap by providing a structured and user-friendly platform where users can explore businesses categorized into various domains such as medical, food, tutoring, and general services.

The application not only benefits users seeking services but also empowers business owners by providing them with a simple interface to register and showcase their offerings. Designed with scalability in mind, the system supports future integrations such as maps, authentication systems, and user-generated feedback.

#  Problem Statement

Users often face challenges in discovering relevant local businesses due to:

Lack of structured categorization
Limited access to verified business information
Inefficient search mechanisms
Absence of user feedback and ratings

Similarly, small business owners struggle to gain visibility without complex onboarding systems.

This project aims to solve these problems by developing a centralized, easy-to-use platform that enables efficient business discovery and registration.

# 🎯 Objectives

The primary objectives of the Business Directory Application are:

* To provide a simple and intuitive platform for users to search businesses by category and subcategory

# 🔗 API Integration
## 🔹 Overview

The Business Directory Application uses a RESTful API-based integration to enable communication between the Angular frontend and the .NET backend. The frontend sends HTTP requests to the backend, which processes the requests, interacts with the SQL database, and returns structured JSON responses.

This approach ensures a clear separation between the user interface and the business logic, making the system scalable and maintainable.

## 🔹 Integration Approach
The frontend communicates with the backend using HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.)
Angular services are used to manage API calls centrally
The backend exposes APIs that handle business logic and data operations
Data is exchanged in JSON format
## 🔹 Authentication Integration
The system uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure communication
After successful login, a token is generated by the backend
This token is included in request headers for accessing protected resources
Ensures that only authenticated users can interact with secured APIs
## 🔹 CAPTCHA Integration
CAPTCHA is integrated into the authentication process
Helps prevent automated or bot-based login attempts
Enhances overall application security
## 🔹 Swagger Integration
Swagger is used for:
API documentation
Testing backend endpoints
Verifying request and response structures
It simplifies development by providing a clear interface to interact with APIs
## 🔹 Error Handling
The backend returns appropriate HTTP status codes for different scenarios
The frontend handles these responses and displays meaningful messages to users
This improves user experience and helps in debugging
## 🔹 Benefits of API Integration
Decouples frontend and backend for independent development
Improves scalability and flexibility
Enables secure communication using JWT
Simplifies testing and debugging with Swagger

# 🔄 Application Flow
## 🔹 Overview

The Application Flow describes how users interact with the system from login to business discovery and feedback submission. The flow is designed to be simple, intuitive, and user-friendly, ensuring minimal steps to achieve desired actions.

```


After successful authentication using JWT and CAPTCHA, the system identifies the user role and directs them to the respective dashboard.

## User Flow:
The user navigates through categories and subcategories to view business listings, access detailed information, and submit ratings and comments.
## Client Flow (Business Owner):
The client accesses the dashboard to register a business by providing required details. Once submitted, the data is stored in the database and reflected in the system.
## Admin Flow:
The admin manages system data, including businesses and categories, ensuring data integrity and smooth system operation.

This unified flow ensures structured navigation, secure access, and efficient interaction across all user roles.
